The [`reduce()` method on JavaScript arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) executes a "reducer" function on every
element of the array in order, passing the return value from the previous reducer
call to the next reducer call. The `reduce()` function is a common cause
of confusion, but it can also make your code much more readable when combined with other [functional programming abstractions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter6.html).
Here are 4 common examples and 1 not-so-common example that demonstrate how to use `reduce()`.

Summing an Array of Numbers
---------------------------

Most `reduce()` tutorials start with this example: given an array of numbers `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, calculate the sum. Here's how you might sum up an array with a plain old [`for` loop](/for-vs-for-each-vs-for-in-vs-for-of-in-javascript).

```javascript
function sum(arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const val of arr) {
    sum += val;
  }
  return sum;
}

sum([1, 3, 5, 7]); // 16
```

Here's an equivalent example using `reduce()`:

```javascript
function sum(arr) {
  const reducer = (sum, val) => sum + val;
  const initialValue = 0;
  return arr.reduce(reducer, initialValue);
}

sum([1, 3, 5, 7]); // 16
```

The `reduce()` function's first 2 parameters are a function `reducer()` and
an arbitrary `initialValue`. JavaScript then calls the `reducer()` on each
element of the array with the _accumulator_ value as the first parameter.
The accumulator starts as `initialValue`, and then JavaScript uses the return
value of each `reduce()` call as the new accumulator.

Talk is cheap, show me the code. So here's a quick example of how you might
implement a simplified `reduce()` function using `for` loops.

```javascript
function reduce(arr, reducer, initialValue) {
  let accumulator = initialValue;
  for (const val of array) {
    accumulator = reducer(accumulator, val);
  }
  return accumulator;
}
```

Summing an Array of Numeric Properties
----------------------------------

The `reduce()` function by itself is often more confusing than helpful.
If all you need to do is sum an array of numbers, you might be better
off using a `for` loop. But, when combined with other array methods like
[`filter()`](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/filter) and `map()`,
`reduce()` starts looking more appealing.

For example, suppose you have an array of line items, and you want to calculate
the sum of each line item's `total` property.

```javascript
const lineItems = [
  { description: 'Eggs (Dozen)', quantity: 1, price: 3, total: 3 },
  { description: 'Cheese', quantity: 0.5, price: 5, total: 2.5 },
  { description: 'Butter', quantity: 2, price: 6, total: 12 }
];
```

Here's one way to add up the line items `total` using `reduce()`:

```javascript
lineItems.reduce((sum, li) => sum + li.total, 0); // 17.5
```

This works, but is less composable. A better alternative is to first
`map()` to get the `total`.

```javascript
lineItems.map(li => li.total).reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
```

Why is this second approach better? Because you can abstract out the
reducer into a function `sum()`, and reuse it wherever you need to sum
up an array.

```javascript
// Sum the totals
lineItems.map(li => li.total).reduce(sumReducer, 0);

// Sum the quantities using the same reducer
lineItems.map(li => li.quantity).reduce(sumReducer, 0);

function sumReducer(sum, val) {
  return sum + val;
}
```

This is important because, while you think `sumReducer()` will never
change, it will. For example, the above code doesn't account for the fact that
`0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3` in JavaScript. This is a common mistake when calculating
prices in an interpretted language. [Binary floating points are weird](/a-nodejs-perspective-on-mongodb-34-decimal.html#whats-wrong-with-binary-floating-points).
So you actually need to round:

```javascript
const { round } = require('lodash');

function sumReducer(sum, val) {
  // Round to 2 decimal places.
  return _.round(sum + val, 2);
}
```

`reduce()` makes it easy to reuse logic like `sumReducer()` throughout your app
using function chaining. So you can change your logic once rather than searching
through every `for` loop in your app.

Find the Maximum Value
--------------

While `reduce()` is often used for summing, it doesn't have to be.
The `accumulator` can be any value: number, `null`, `undefined`,
array, [POJO](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/pojo), even a [promise](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/promise).

For example, suppose you have an array of JavaScript dates, and you want
to find the most recent date.

```javascript
const dates = [
  '2019/06/01',
  '2018/06/01',
  '2019/09/01', // This is the most recent date, but how to find it?
  '2018/09/01'
].map(v => new Date(v));
```

One approach is to sort the array and take the last element in the sorted
array. That works, but isn't as efficient as it could be, and [sorting an array of dates in JavaScript is non-trivial](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/compare-dates#sorting).

Instead, you can use `reduce()` and make your reducer return the most
recent date found so far.

```javascript
// This works because you can compare JavaScript dates using `>` and `<`.
// So `a > b` if and only if `a` is after `b`.
const maxDate = dates.reduce((max, d) => d > max ? d : max, dates[0]);
```

Grouping Values
--------------

Given an array of objects with an `age` property:

```javascript
const characters = [
  { name: 'Jean-Luc Picard', age: 59 },
  { name: 'Will Riker', age: 29 },
  { name: 'Deanna Troi', age: 29 }
];
```

How do you return a map that contains how many characters have a given
`age`? For example, the correct output on the above array would be
`{ 29: 2, 59: 1 }`.

Here's how you can do that with `reduce()`.

```javascript
// Start with an empty object, increment `map[age]` for each element
// of the array.
const reducer = (map, val) => {
  if (map[val] == null) {
    map[val] = 1;
  } else {
    ++map[val];
  }
  return map;
};
characters.map(char => char.age).reduce(reducer, {});
```

Bonus: [Promise Chaining](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/promise-chaining)
-------------------

Suppose you have an array of [async functions](https://thecodebarbarian.com/async-functions-in-javascript.html) that you want to execute in series.
There is a non-standard [`promise.series` function](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise.series)
for this, but you can also do this with `reduce()`.

```javascript
const functions = [
  async function() { return 1; },
  async function() { return 2; },
  async function() { return 3; }
];

// Chain the function calls in order, starting with an empty promise.
// In the end, `res` is equivalent to
// `Promise.resolve().then(fn1).then(fn2).then(fn3)`
const res = await functions.
  reduce((promise, fn) => promise.then(fn), Promise.resolve());
res; // 3
```

Moving On
--------

The `reduce()` function is a powerful tool. By abstracting out filters
and reducers, you can consolidate common tasks like "summing an array of numbers"
into a separate function for easier refactoring and DRY-er code.
