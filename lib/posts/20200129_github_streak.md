On January 2, 2016, I started a personal goal of doing at least 30 minutes
of coding every day for 1000 days. I hit that goal in September 2018,
and then kept on going. Below is my contributions graph, courtesy
of [github-contributions.now.sh](https://github-contributions.now.sh/).

It has been quite the adventure. I didn't go into an office every day,
I ended up working from some pretty odd places. I wrote a bunch of
[Archetype's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/archetype) handling for
recursive defaults from [a fishing lodge in the panhandle of Alaska](http://www.glacierbearlodge.com/default.aspx?pg=amenities). I had a major
breakthrough for [monogram](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monogram) on
a train ride from Wonju to Seoul in South Korea, after losing my cell phone to a
torrential downpour while hiking in [Chiaksan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaksan_National_Park). I cleaned up a lot of deprecation warnings for
[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) from a penthouse balcony overlooking
the Mediterranean in Nice. I didn't like France though, I much preferred
working from a villa in Montenegro.

Why the 1000 day goal? I found myself with more responsibilities -
Mongoose was growing rapidly, and I was about to join a [growing early stage startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/booster-fuels) that needed a top notch
backend engineer. I had a knack for coding from a young age, and, while
I wasn't exactly coasting on raw talent, I also knew I had gotten
away with not giving the craft my all. To match the opportunity I had,
I needed to crank my commitment level up to 11.

## You have free time every day

You might find this surprising: I'm not "hard working" in the way that
makes headlines. I don't [start practicing at 5am like Kobe Bryant did](https://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-insane-work-ethic-2013-8). I'm usually starting
up around 8am or 9am. I'm no night owl, I like to be asleep by 11.
And I don't check email after 8pm. No [hustle porn](https://www.fastcompany.com/90366162/hustle-porn-and-the-american-dream) here.

However, we all have 20-30 minutes here and there over the
course of the day, and what we choose to do with that time adds up.
Do you choose to work on your craft, do you choose to scroll through 
Instagram, or do you choose to catch an
extra TV show on Netflix? I made the choice to put that little extra effort into
being a better coder and a better writer.

And little choices add up. Herculean efforts make the headlines, but the
real results come from small habits and steady progress that most don't notice.

## Having a purpose is good for you

It's easy to fall into bad habits when you have nothing to do - drinking too
much, staying up too late, and binging League of Legends too often. [Idle hands are the devil's workshop](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idle_hands_are_the_devil%27s_workshop#English).

Conversely, being committed to coding every day made me rethink everything
else. It made me more committed to maintaining my health, eating right,
exercising, and saving money.

However, having a purpose doesn't necessarily turn you into a monk either.
Far from it. I enjoy an easy day now and then. Usually I spend weekend
afternoons sitting on the beach reading a good book. And there's no shortage
of time for going out for drinks with friends. Leisure feels
better after you've made some progress toward your goal that day.

## Love what you do

[I work at my local WeWork](/why-i-work-remotely.html), so I'm constantly
bombarded with WeWork's ["do what you love" slogan](https://www.wework.com/ideas/dwyl-you-cant-fake-it). "Do what you love" is some of the worst life advice
you can ever give someone. It implies a certain passivity, where you wait
for something that you "love" and then start working on it. Then you fall
out of love with it when things get a little hard, and you move on to something else.

Things are more two-sided than that. Your purpose doesn't just magically appear and
immediately make your life all [sunshine and rainbows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_Vg4uyYwEk). Its more of a feedback loop - effort yields results, which makes
you want to put in more effort.

Whatever you're working on now, putting your heart and soul into it gives
you the best chance for success. And if that success comes, you might find
yourself honestly "doing what you love", or at least closer than you would
have gotten by reading [motivational listicles](https://www.hustleinspireshustle.com/blog/best-hustle-quotes-to-motivate-you).

## Moving On

Will my GitHub streak continue? I'm not sure. My priorities and
responsibilities are shifting again. I'm looking to work in batches
more - isolating individual days for certain projects and other days for
fun, as opposed to doing a little bit every day. But whatever the future
brings, I'm going to be putting my best into what I'm doing, and
making the most of those small quiet gaps in otherwise busy days.
