[OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) is a protocol for allowing one application
controlled access to a user's account on another application. It is
commonly used for two purposes:

- Single sign on, like via [Facebook login](https://codeburst.io/node-js-rest-api-facebook-login-121114ee04d8)
- Apps built to make it easier to deal with other apps, like [Buffer for scheduling tweets on Twitter](https://buffer.com/)

In this article, I'll describe how to build a minimal OAuth server
with Node.js and [Express](http://expressjs.com/), no OAuth modules allowed.
The only exception is [Matt Mueller's excellent `oauth-open` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oauth-open) for displaying an OAuth popup on the client side to verify that we actually have a working OAuth setup.

The OAuth Flow
--------------

Your standard web OAuth 2.0 flow has 3 steps:

1. Your app client opens a dialog that displays a dialog that asks the user to authorize your app. The dialog is usually on a different domain, like [Facebook's OAuth login dialog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/#logindialog).
2. The dialog redirects back to your app client's domain with an _auth code_ in the query string. An auth code is a short-lived code that you can exchange for a long-lived _access token_.
3. Your app pulls the `code` parameter from the query string, and makes a POST request to the authorizing app's server with the access code. The authorizing app's server verifies the access code and sends back an _access token_ your app can use for authorization going forward.

For the purposes of this example, there's 2 components involved in the
OAuth flow:

1. The client app. You can think of this as your app that's trying to get access to data from the authorizing app.
2. The authorizing app. You can think of this as Facebook, Google, Twitter, or some other app that your client app is trying to access on the user's behalf.

Client App Implementation
--------------

_Note that this code is meant as a minimal didactic example. The below code
is most definitely **not** a production-grade OAuth authorization server. Don't copy/paste it into your prod app._

First, let's take a look at the client app to see what endpoints the
authorization server needs to implement. The client app server's entry
point is a simple static server listening on port 3000:

```javascript
'use strict';
  
const express = require('express');

run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  const app = express();

  app.use(express.static('./'));

  await app.listen(3000);
  console.log('Listening on port 3000');
}
```

The client app has one file, `index.html`. This file is responsible for opening an OAuth dialog, exchanging the auth code for an access token, and making an HTTP request to a secure endpoint using the access token as authorization. The
auth server will run on `http://localhost:3001`.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="content"></div>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://codebarbarian-images.s3.amazonaws.com/open.dist.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Step 1: open an OAuth dialog
      oauthOpen('http://localhost:3001/oauth-dialog.html', async (err, code) => {
        // Step 2: exchange the code for an access token
        const resToken = await axios.post('http://localhost:3001/token', { code: code.code });

        // Step 3: use the access token to make a request to a secure
        // endpoint and display some data
        const res = await axios.get('http://localhost:3001/secure', {
          headers: { authorization: resToken.data['access_token'] }
        });

        document.querySelector('#content').innerHTML =
          `The secret answer is ${res.data.answer}`;
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `https://codebarbarian-images.s3.amazonaws.com/open.dist.js` file
in the above example is a [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) bundle of the below script. I pre-compiled that script for convenience so the code in this
article doesn't require a compiler.

```
window.oauthOpen = require('oauth-open');
```

The client also needs an `oauth-callback.html` file. The `oauth-callback.html` file doesn't need to do anything, the `oauthOpen()` function takes care of pulling out the auth code. Here's a minimal `oauth-callback.html`:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div>Authorized</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Auth Server Implementation
--------------------------

The auth server needs 4 endpoints:

1. An OAuth dialog that asks the user to authorize the client app.
2. A route that generates an auth code and redirects to the client app.
3. A route to exchange an auth code for an access token.
4. A "secure" endpoint that only responds if it is given a valid access token via the [`Authorization` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization).

Since the auth server will run on a different domain than the client app, it also needs [CORS](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/cors) for the
access token and secure endpoints in order to avoid the browser throwing errors about cross-origin requests. However, it is important to protect the endpoint
for getting an auth code secure from cross-origin requests because of
[CSRF attacks](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/01/protect-your-node-js-app-from-cross-site-request-forgery.html).

The flow starts when the user opens the OAuth dialog. In this example,
the authorization server has a static `oauth-dialog.html` file that
shows a single button the user can click to authorize the client app.
Clicking the button redirects to a `/code` route that is responsible
for generating an auth code and redirecting to the client app.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div>Authorize OAuth Test App?</div>

    <form action="/code" method="POST">
      <button type="submit">OK</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

Below is the full `auth-server.js` file:

```javascript
'use strict';

const cors = require('cors');
const express = require('express');

run().catch(err => console.log(err));

async function run() {
  const app = express();
  
  // Store the auth codes and access tokens in memory. In a real
  // auth server, you would store these in a database.
  const authCodes = new Set();
  const accessTokens = new Set();
  
  app.use(express.json());

  // Generate an auth code and redirect to your app client's
  // domain with the auth code
  app.post('/code', (req, res) => {
    // Generate a string of 10 random digits
    const authCode = new Array(10).fill(null).map(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)).join('');

    authCodes.add(authCode);
    
    // Normally this would be a `redirect_uri` parameter, but for
    // this example it is hard coded.
    res.redirect(`http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback.html?code=${authCode}`);
  });
  
  app.options('/token', cors(), (req, res) => res.end());
  app.options('/secure', cors(), (req, res) => res.end());

  // Verify an auth code and exchange it for an access token
  app.post('/token', cors(), (req, res) => {
    if (authCodes.has(req.body.code)) {
      // Generate a string of 50 random digits
      const token = new Array(50).fill(null).map(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)).join('');

      authCodes.delete(req.body.code);
      accessTokens.add(token);
      res.json({ 'access_token': token, 'expires_in': 60 * 60 * 24 });
    } else {
      res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid auth token' });
    }
  });

    // Endpoint secured by auth token
  app.get('/secure', cors(), (req, res) => {
    const authorization = req.get('authorization');
    if (!accessTokens.has(authorization)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Unauthorized' });
    }

    return res.json({ answer: 42 });
  });

  // Serve up `oauth-dialog.html`
  app.use(express.static('./'));
      
  await app.listen(3001);
  console.log('Listening on port 3001');
}
```

Note that the `/code` endpoint, as written, is vulnerable to [cross-site request forgery attacks](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/01/protect-your-node-js-app-from-cross-site-request-forgery.html). A malicious
website could POST a form to the `/code` endpoint and that would trigger the
OAuth flow without the user's knowledge. You can use a module like
[csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) to generate CSRF tokens.

Moving On
---------

OAuth may seem baffling to beginners, but the process of implementing an
OAuth server is simple once you understand the OAuth flow. All you
need is a dialog, an endpoint to get an auth code, and an endpoint
to exchange an auth code for an access token. Once you give a user
an access token, they are effectively "logged in" to the authorizing
app.

If you're looking to implement a real OAuth server, the next step is
to store the auth codes and access tokens in a database. For more
sophisticated apps, you may want to
add support for [OAuth scopes](https://oauth.net/2/scope/), which
inform the user what permissions the client app has, like whether
the client app has permission to tweet on your behalf.
