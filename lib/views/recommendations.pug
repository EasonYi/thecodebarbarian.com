      ### [2ality](http://2ality.com/)

      No blog does a better job of keeping up with the cutting edge of JavaScript.
      Dr. Rauschmayer is always the first one to summarize new ECMAScript spec
      features in a developer-friendly way.

      ### [Better World By Better Software](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/)

      Dr. Gleb Bahmutov is the VP of Engineering at
      [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) and arguably the world's foremost
      expert on JavaScript testing. This blog is like
      [Top Gun](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/tom-skerritts-speech-to-the-cadets-in-top-gun-is-probably-long-enough-as-it-is)
      for testing: even if you're the best of the best, Gleb will make you better.

      ### [Kent C. Dodds on Medium](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/)

      Kent's blog is my preferred source for everything React-related.

      ### [_Mongoose for Application Development_ by Simon Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782168192/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1782168192&linkCode=as2&tag=codebarbarian-20&linkId=c001bbe52f46aa47d2a79d318ed79b93)

      This is the book on Mongoose. Even though it is from 2013,
      _Mongoose for Application Development_ has stood the test of time. This
      book does an excellent job summarizing the core ideas that make Mongoose so
      powerful. Just sub out callbacks for promises.

      ### [_The Little MongoDB Schema Design Book_ by Christian Kvalheim](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1517394023/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1517394023&linkCode=as2&tag=codebarbarian-20&linkId=c019ac677e17150c6825404726780e1a)

      Christian Kvalheim originally wrote the MongoDB Node.js driver in early 2010,
      and maintained the driver almost singlehandedly until 2017. As maintainer
      of the Node.js driver, Christian saw more Node.js on MongoDB codebases than
      anyone, and his experience with what works and what doesn't is unmatched.
      This book distills 6 years of hard-learned lessons into concrete examples
      of how to design MongoDB schemas for massive scale. If you want to learn
      how to structure MongoDB schemas for an ecommerce store, a category tree, or a
      blog that can support hundreds of millions of requests per day, this is
      the book for you.
